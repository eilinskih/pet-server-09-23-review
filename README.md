I compile ts files manually for education reasons and just for curious, 
so for start the project locally you will have to open 2 terminal instances simultaneously (1: yarn tscompile; 2: yarn dev).

Roadmap topics covered:
1) Implemented authentication (cookie session)
2) Working with CORS headers
3) REST endpoints
4) Partially covered by Typescript
5) Learned about namespaces (practical task not done, just extended express Request type in it`s namespace)
